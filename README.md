This project improves 2D curves in images using image processing techniques. It starts by loading the image, inverting colors, and converting it to binary. The process includes regularization to smooth curves, symmetry enforcement by blending original and mirrored images, and curve completion using dilation and erosion. The enhanced curves are displayed alongside the original image to highlight the effectiveness of these methods.
